# Parameter estimations todo
We want to test that were there are NR simulations the results are better with the hybrid model and identincal to v4Tsurr
were there are no simulation

- [ ] Inject a hybrid waveform used for the training
	- [ ] check that the mismatch with the corresponding NR simulation is extremaly small
- [ ] Check bilby code from Micheal  
- [ ] Start Bilby run on thin
- [ ] do a Bilby run for v4Tsurrogate in non spinning case
