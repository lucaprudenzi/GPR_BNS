- Presentation [10-15min] summarizing 
	- what the project is about
	- the current status of the GPR model 
	- attempts of parameter estimations
- Comparinson for GPR pakages
	- produce plot for amplitude and phase for common set of predicted points
- sample from GPR model
	- produce plot for amplitude and phase sampling several times for the same paramters
